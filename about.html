		<p id="centerText">My name is Alexander Nolte, and I am a junior at IUPUI. My program is CIT with a concentration in Web Development. I was at Ivy Tech for 2 years obtaining an Associates degree in IT, then transfered to IUPUI to obtain my Bachelors. When I first got into developement, my high school was using a program called GameMaker, so some of my first experiences in IT/development were creating small games. Nowadays, I mostly work in Python and Java. I have experience in HTML and CSS, and I am learning JavaScript in CIT 215 with Professor Luke Jones</p>
